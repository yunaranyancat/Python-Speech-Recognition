i'm currently experimenting with Python Speech Recognition library to create some bots;

Incoming ideas:
DictBot
- Handle greetings
- Handle general knowledge / dictionary based questions
- Add TTS
- Add GUI

QuoteBot
- Share some random quotes
- Add quote to collection
- GUI

ActionBot
- Handle basic action in computer (Linux/Windows)

Next step : + artificial intelligence, machine learning bot
